# Project Euler Offline
This is a quick program I threw together before getting on a plane so I would be able to solve PE problems and check solutions without having internet access. The program decrypts an encrypted file that contains the solutions, so there are no spoilers in plain text.

## Getting the problems offline
1. Register and login to PE
2. Go to <http://projecteuler.net/show=all>
3. Save the page to your computer
